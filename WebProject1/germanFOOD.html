    <td><img src="Pics/Bratwurst.jpeg" width="730px" height="487px"/><br> Bratwurst is a type of German sausage made from
        veal, beef, or most commonly pork. The name is derived from the Old High German Brätwurst, from brät-, finely
        chopped meat, and Wurst, sausage, although in modern German it is often associated with the verb braten, to pan
        fry or roast.
